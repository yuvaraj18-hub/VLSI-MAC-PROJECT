# VLSI MAC Project (Multiply and Accumulate Unit)

This project is a *Pipelined MAC (Multiply and Accumulate)* unit designed using *Verilog* and tested on *EDA Playground*.

 Project Description:

The Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) unit is a key component in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and AI accelerators. This design features:
- Pipelined architecture
- Parallel multiply and accumulate stages
- Low power and efficient structure
- Developed using Verilog HDL

Files Included:

- pipelined_mac.v â€“ Verilog design of the MAC unit  
- tb_pipelined_mac.v â€“ Testbench used for simulation  
- vlsi_mac_project.zip â€“ Complete zip of all files  
- waveform.png â€“ Screenshot of the waveform (optional, can add if needed)  

Simulation:

The project was simulated and tested using:
- ðŸ§ª *EDA Playground*  
- ðŸ“Š Waveform viewer: *EPWave / GTKWave*  

Tested successfully with inputs A, B and reset logic.

>> How to Run

1. Upload the Verilog files to [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)
2. Choose simulator: Icarus Verilog
3. Enable EPWave viewer
4. Click *Run* and view the waveform output

>> Learning Outcomes

- VLSI digital design concepts
- Pipelining techniques
- Verilog coding and testbench writing
- Using EDA Playground for simulation
